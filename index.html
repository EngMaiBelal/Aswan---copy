                            </h1>
                            <p>Luxor, which was once known as Thebes (the capital of Ancient Egypt) is located in Southern Egypt- 670 km South of Cairo. Luxor today is a city of around 150,000 people. This city is prominent for being an “open air museum” because of its unique archaeological monuments.
                                    Luxor is the second most visited tourist city in Egypt after Cairo. Extravagant monuments such as Karnak Temple, The Luxor Temple, Valley of Kings, Valley of Queens and many more are the reason for this.
                            </p>
                            <!-- <p>Aswan, (previously known as Syene during Ancient Egypt) is located about 81 KM south of Luxor. This small modern city has a population of about 230,000 people who are mostly Nubians. (People of an ancient region of Northeastern Africa)
                                    Aswan is distinctively embellished for having a beautiful setting on the Nile.
